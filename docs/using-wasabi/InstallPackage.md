It is strongly recommended to **VERIFY PGP SIGNATURES** of the downloaded packages before installing Wasabi. This protects you against malicious phising sites giving you back-doored Wallet software. Don't trust - Verify!

Download the packages either from the official [WasabiWallet.io](https://wasabiwallet.io/) clearnet website, or for your privacy sake from the official tor hidden service [http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/](http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/).

If you have personally verified Ádám Ficsor's PGP key and you are familiar with the [Web Of Trust](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/147447/gpg-why-is-my-trusted-key-not-certified-with-a-trusted-signature), please consider also [signing it](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html).
